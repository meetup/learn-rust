While this repository serves as an introduction to the the programming language,
Rust has attracted a very friendly and open community that is full
full of great resources to learn more. Below is a list of some personal
recommendations. Additions are welcome!

## tools

* [cargo/crates.io](https://crates.io/) cargo is the official build tool for Rust, it is also a tool used for publishing "crates" to a central repository to facilitate an ecosystem of sharing. As of this time, there's about a 1 in 8,943 chance of finding a crate to suit your needs

* [error docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html) Rust has invested a lot of effort into providing a useful error reporting experience. In addition to compiler output, you can also consult this document which serves as an index to all compile time errors, and explanation of how to correct your programs

## what's with the crab?

* That's [ferris](http://www.rustacean.net/), Rust's unofficial mascot
* [rustacean](https://www.google.com/search?q=rustacean)?!? That's another name of a rust enthusiast, Similar to pythonista in python, ect

## what to look forward to

Rust's release cycle commitment includes new a release [every 6 weeks](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html). The project also outlines an
